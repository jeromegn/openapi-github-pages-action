# smithy-gh-pages-action
GitHub Action to generate API documentation from Smithy models and deploy to GitHub Pages.

### Requirements
Client projects must be built using Gradle, and provide a Gradle task that generates a OpenAPI JSON specification file from their Smithy models.

### Usage
See [action.yml](https://github.com/msayson/smithy-gh-pages-action/action.yml)

Add the following permissions to your GitHub workflow, prior to the lines defining workflow jobs.

```yaml
# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
```

Add the following steps to your GitHub workflow, replacing the input values:

```yaml
- name: Generate API docs from Smithy models and deploy to GitHub Pages
  uses: msayson/smithy-gh-pages-action@v1.0.0
  with:
    # Name of the Gradle task to generate the OpenAPI JSON spec from Smithy models
    # Default: build
    gradle-smithy-task-name: 'REPLACE_WITH_GRADLE_TASK_NAME'
    # Filepath of the OpenAPI JSON spec generated by your Smithy models package
    openapi-json-filepath: 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_OPENAPI_JSON_FILEPATH'
    # Directory to create/use for generating the OpenAPI YAML spec
    openapi-yaml-directory: 'REPLACE_WITH_NEW_OPENAPI_YAML_DIR'
    # Directory to create/use for generating the API docs HTML
    api-docs-directory: 'REPLACE_WITH_NEW_API_HTML_DOCS_DIR'
```

### Workflow example
```yaml
name: Generate API Docs

on:
  # Automatically trigger when push to main branch
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  # Enable running workflow manually from GitHub Actions
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  generate-api-docs:
    name: Generate API Documentation
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Generate API docs and deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: msayson/smithy-gh-pages-action@v1.0.0
        with:
          gradle-smithy-task-name: build
          openapi-json-filepath: build/smithyprojections/consent-management-api-models/source/openapi/ConsentManagementApi.openapi.json
          openapi-yaml-directory: build/openapi
          api-docs-directory: build/docs
